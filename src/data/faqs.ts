    question: "Why is eco-friendly, handmade clothing more expensive?",
    answer: "Each piece is individually crafted using time-intensive techniques like eco-printing, shibori, and batik. We use premium natural fabrics and sustainable dyes. The process takes days, not minutes, and requires skilled artisan work. You're investing in quality, uniqueness, and environmental responsibility – pieces that last years and never go out of style."

    question: "Will the colors and prints fade?",
    answer: "With proper care, our natural dyes maintain their beauty for years. We use mordants that help fix colors to fabric. Some slight evolution in tone is natural and adds character. Following our care instructions – hand washing or cold machine wash with mild detergent, drying in shade – will preserve your piece's vibrancy."

    question: "How do I care for my eco-printed clothing?",
    answer: "Hand wash or cold machine wash with mild, pH-neutral detergent. Avoid bleach and harsh chemicals. Air dry in shade – direct sunlight can affect natural dyes. Iron on reverse side at medium heat. Store away from direct light. With love and care, your piece will age beautifully."

    question: "Will the fabric shrink?",
    answer: "We pre-wash all fabrics before crafting, which minimizes shrinkage. Natural fabrics like cotton and linen may have minimal shrinkage (1-2%) on first wash. Silk pieces should be dry cleaned for best results. Always follow care instructions for your specific piece."

    question: "How long will my order take?",

    question: "Are designs restocked or one-time only?",
    answer: "Because each piece is truly one-of-a-kind – the exact position of leaves, the way dye flows, the natural variations – no two pieces are ever identical. Similar styles may be available, but your exact piece is uniquely yours. This is the beauty of handmade!"
